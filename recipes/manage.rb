# This recipe is in place of default.rb I thought it unwise to have a default.rb
# that cleared peoples RAID configurations out the box. You have to implicitly
# include this raid::manage recipe before the attributes set on your node will
# be applied. It is worth noting the configuration is cleared and rewritten on every
# run, therefore you probably don't want this in your default run list. I use it from
# solo for a single shot configuration on a new server.
#

# A defined config will take priority over a template
